  Hello! My name is Calais and I am a 6th grader attending Miller Middle School. I love to get into new activities and dip my toes into things I've never tried.  I also love creating things for people to see.
  
  I first started getting into "coding" this year when I was in a class called Tynker where we used a website that used Blockly. I really enjoyed it but I realized this wasn't the way I could create things that other people could use.
  So, I looked for ways I could actually start writing code and making new things. I came across a club at Miller called Girls Who Code. This club sounded perfect for me so I made sure I went to the first meeting to learn more about it and I decided to stick with it.
  I'm so glad I found Girls Who Code because that's how I learned to code in JavaScript, CSS and HTML. I wouldn't have made this website if I hadn't gone to Girls Who Code.
