  Hi again! My name is Calais and I have some hobbies that I want to share with you.
  
  Violin:
  
  I have been playing the violin for 5 years and I love it. I knew I always wanted to play the violin and when I finally started playing it I knew I would stick with it forever.
  I play in an orchestra and take private lessons. 
  
  Track & Field:
  
  I joined my school's track team this year and I loved it. I did 65m hurdles, 800 m run and long jump.  I know I want to do Track & Field next year because I enjoyed it, even though it was time consuming.
  
  Other than coding, these are the hobbies I like to do in my free time.
